# Bulk File Renamer

## Goals:

Use article.py as base for File Renamer which swaps spaces and underscores for dashes. 

## Progress:
+ **2022-01-12:** Copied article's code.

+ **2022-01-22:** Started and "finished" main.py, it seems to work fine? Wasn't too difficult. Maybe add a GUI? Kinda dislike Terminal applications. Not sure how tho.
